# PHPscheduler
A simple scheduler app made for the PHP basics course at Laurea.

The application stores user accounts and allows users to create events. Weekly events are then displayed on the 
front page after logging in. Front end was done using HTML5 and CSS, using Bootstrap. Also some simple JavaScript was used
for the sake of practice. This was a pair project and the original repository was made by my partner for the assignment.

The database used to store user accoutns and scheduled events was hosted on Microsoft Azure, and it is no longer available.
